<b><u>Best Players</u></b>
<br>
<br>
                          Lots of talk this year about who is the best player in the OGT but many speculate the system.
                          Like the College Football Playoffs, the OGT has run into a system malfunction.  Tyler Shaw was deemed the OGT Tour Champion
                          in 2018.  He did not have the highest points though.  This leads to speculation that players like  Ross Leduc "The Frenchman",
                          Rob Smyth "The Irishman", "The new kid on the block" Shennan Moore and the "I'm going to search for my ball in the woods for 10 minutes" Tony Clark
                          should be seen as the top players over Shaw.
<br>
<br>
                         <b><u>My Top 5</u></b>
<br>
                         Shennan Moore,
                         Rob Smyth,
                         Tony Clark,
                         Ross Leduc,
                         Tyler Shaw,
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Worst Players</u></b>
<br>
<br>                      This may be a sore subject for the players listed on here but I don't get paid for your feelings. Shit, I'm out of a job, I don't have a job so I don't
                          get paid at all right now. What I do get is to write a truthful article on who we should we get to see struggle, fighting to not get the toilet bowl this year.
                          Like above, The toilet boil trophy is given to the "worst" deemed player on tour but this doesn't mean they are the worst. No doubt in my mind, Chris Harrigan
                          has one the toilet bowl trophy and he is far from being at the bottom of the list.<br>

                            <a href="#" class="date">January 2019</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="para"> <b>Tony Clark Vs Shennan Moore</b>
<br>
<br>
                         This is a match up that definitely needs to take place again.  Shennan played Tony and took
                          him down the last time these two played.  I think in a more open course, this can go either way.
                          Both of them are pure ball strikers and can hit the ball a mile.
<br>
<br>                      <b>Tim Smyth Vs Mike "Commish" Totten</b> <br>
<br>                         I think this match can go either way.
                             Tim has been working in the off season and getting a lot of rounds in at Grand Cypress.
                             Totten took the initial victory between these two but I think if caddies come into play,
                             <b>I think Tim gets a large advantage having his brother caddying.  Totten would most likely
                             go with Aaron Horne because he is a great calming factor on the course or Eli Roe because of his insane putting skills.
                            </b>  This is an under the radar death
                             match that I would definitely like to see.
<br>
<br>                      <b>Jerrod Paul Vs Mike "The Mouth" Torres</b>
<br>
                           <br>JP took down "The Mouth" the last time they played on a brand new course that Torres
                            never saw before.  When we asked Torres about the round his response: "This was a setup! This guy played me on a course that he knew".
                            Torres sounded very upset after the interview and is looking to hunt down JP for a death match.  Going into this match, JP would probably
                            be the favorite.
<br>
<br>
                          <b>Irishman Vs Frenchman</b>
                          <br>
                          <br> This is a match I'd sell blood to watch.  These are two of top players on tour that have both work/worked
                          in the golf indsutry and have much respect for the game.  Both of them are scratch golfers and either one could win.  Ross has a stellar all around
                          game where if he starts pin seeking Rob could be in trouble. On the other hand, Rob plays on momentum and if he's dialed in he is almost impossible
                          to beat because of his short game and especially is putting.
